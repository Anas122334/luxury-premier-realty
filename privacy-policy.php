We usually share your Personal Information with other Users, Website hosting partners, and other reputable third parties who help us manage and offer our Service, conduct our business, or provide you with services to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the operation of the Service.

    </ul>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Numerous Users</h4>
    <p class="">To fulfill your requests and provide the Service, we may need to share some of your Personal Information with other Users. For instance, we will give another User your name and contact information if you decide to buy, sell, or rent Property from them. If the other User requests it or you want to send it to them voluntarily, we will provide that extra information in line with your request. This information sharing is necessary to provide the Service to you. No one else can access your account name, password, or financial data.</p>
    <p class="">In addition, we allow users to invite friends to utilize the Service by asking for their personal information. We may use the personal data of prospective users to get in touch with them and request them to use the service, evaluate the success of our referral program, and confirm the personal data provided. We won't use a potential user's personal information for any other purpose unless they decide not to register as a User, in which case the new User will be subject to the Terms and this Privacy Policy. Suppose a potential user wants to delete their Personal Information. In that case, they can contact us at unsubscribe@ Luxury Premier Realty.com or by clicking the appropriate link in the email or newsletter's body if one is offered.</p>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Independent Service Providers</h4>
    <p class="">We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers or other reputable third-party businesses and individuals to provide and improve the Website and the Service, process payments, examine how our Service is used, manage databases, carry out analytics, and generate statistics about the Service, provide communications and hosting services, strengthen network security, help with technical and customer support, conduct quality assurance testing, and other purposes. These third-party service providers include, but are not limited to, cloud computing providers, payment processors, and internet service providers. The minimal Personal Information we supply these third-party service providers is bound by contract to be used only to fulfill our specified demands. Information exchange is necessary to provide you with the Service and address your requests.</p>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Subsidiaries and Affiliates</h4>
    <p class="">We may release your Personal Information to our subsidiaries and affiliates in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates must maintain the Personal Information that may be given to them per this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Corporate Relocations</h4>
    <p class="">As our business expands, Luxury Premier Realty may occasionally sell or acquire businesses or assets. One of the assets that might be transferred in the case of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or other similar event is personal information. You understand and agree that the terms of this Privacy Policy, including the right to use your Personal Information and additional information, will continue to apply to any successor to or acquirer of Luxury Premier Realty (or its assets). Suppose the privacy policy of any successor to or acquirer will take priority before your personal information is transferred and is subject to a different privacy policy. In that case, we will notify you in advance.</p>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Information Not Associated With Individuals</h4>
    <p class="">Non-personal information cannot be used to identify you individually. Therefore, we may disclose it for any lawful purpose.</p>
    <h4 class="juana fw-bold">Keeping Information Security Up to Date</h4>
    <p>Unless we have special instructions, your consent, or other agreements, we will only keep your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the Service, fulfill a request, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We take commercially reasonable security precautions to safeguard your personal information. On password-protected, restricted-access servers, your personal information is stored. For example, when you send payment information over the Internet, we periodically employ a secure server layer (SSL), which encrypts data before it is delivered. However, there is only a partially secure electronic storage or transmission method over the Internet. We, therefore, cannot guarantee complete security, notwithstanding our efforts to protect your Personal Information using commercially reasonable and acceptable procedures. It would help if you always use caution when disclosing personal information in areas other Users could see.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for monitoring your use of the Website, Service, and Account. Any Account's passwords and user IDs cannot be traded.
